Deque (Doubly ended queue)
===================================================================================
Deque (Doubly Ended Queue) in Python is implemented using the module “collections“. Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker 
append and pop operations from both the ends of container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to 
list which provides O(n) time complexity.
