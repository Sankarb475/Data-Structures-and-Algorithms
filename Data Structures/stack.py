A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle.
a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) such that an instance S supports the following operations::

S.push(e): Add element e to the top of stack S.

S.pop(): Remove and return the top element from the stack S; an error occurs if the stack is empty.

S.top(): Return a reference to the top element of stack S, without removing it; an error occurs if the stack is empty.

S.is empty( ): Return True if stack S does not contain any elements.

len(S): Return the number of elements in stack S
