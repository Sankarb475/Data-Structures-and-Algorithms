Dynamic Programming - 
-- Divding a problam into smaller sub problems.
-- it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.

 in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal 
 solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is 
a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.[1] In the optimization literature this relationship 
is called the Bellman equation.


-- Recursion is needed to resolve this problem.
